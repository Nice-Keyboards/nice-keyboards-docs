# BlueMicro Firmware

## Overview
BlueMicro firmware is the recommended firmware for the nice!nano. It's built specifically for wireless boards using the same chip as the nice!nano.

## Get Started
Out of the sake of not having outdated docs, I will instead point towards the official BlueMicro firmware docs.

### [Documentation](http://bluemicro.jpconstantineau.com/#)

## Notes
 - The BlueMicro firmware supports much more than just the nice!nano, so you must remember to specify the breakoutboard type in the board definition. Details for this will be in the BlueMicro documentation.
